# Frontend Clients

This folder contains four separate client implementations for the TicTacToe AI project. Each client demonstrates how to interact with the same backend API using different technologies and platforms.

## Clients

- **Vanilla JS** — A simple web client built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Vue.js** — A modern reactive web client built using the Vue.js framework.
- **Unity** — A 2D game client implemented with Unity engine, suitable for desktop or mobile.
- **Flutter** — A cross-platform mobile/web client built with Flutter.

- **Flutter** requires Flutter SDK installed; can be run on web, emulator, or physical devices.
